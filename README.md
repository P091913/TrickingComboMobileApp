# TrickingComboMobileApp

### Purpose
## I wanted to learn .NET MAUI on a deeper level by creating a personal application for my iOS device to keep track of my martial arts tricking workouts.

### Requirements
## The project was built with the following
  - .NET 8 (Originally I was using .NET 9. This ran great on Android, however when trying to bridge the connection     to xCode to compile the project for my device. Because my device was on the latest update, it wouldn't compile     for my device. After researching and signing the application with my AppleID & compiling the project in .NET       8, the app installed as expected.
  - An Android Emulator/Device OR iOS Device/xCode Device Simulator


### How it works
  - The project allows you to create, add, edit and delete martial art tricking combos.
  - User can favorite up to 5 combos, these combos are to act as the focus point for each session.
  - Data is read and written to a localDB file stored within the application (no cloud saving).
  -
